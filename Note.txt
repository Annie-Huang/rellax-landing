Speed
Use the data-rellax-speed attribute to set the speed of a .rellax element to something other than
the default value (which is -2). A negative value will make it move slower than regular scrolling,
and a positive value will make it move faster. We recommend keeping the speed between -10 and 10.

Responsive Speed
Use responsive speed attributes for breakpoint levels that require a different speed.
Defaults to the data-rellax-speed setting in unspecified breakpoints.

<div class="rellax" data-rellax-speed="7" data-rellax-xs-speed="-5" data-rellax-mobile-speed="3" data-rellax-tablet-speed="-8" data-rellax-desktop-speed="1">
  I parallax at all different speeds depending on your screen width.
</div>
